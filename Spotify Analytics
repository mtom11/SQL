--For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
--Then, I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
--Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL);

--I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data by asking questions and answering them with the following SQL.
--I listed some answers after the SQL code.

--What is the average danceability by artist and track? Ordered by most danceable.
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability) AS avg_dance
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY avg_dance DESC;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--Which artist released the longest song? Convert the song from milliseconds to minutes.
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms, (duration_ms/1000)/60 AS duration_minutes
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
--Farruko

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, AVG(danceability)
FROM spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

--What is the total duration of all the songs in minutes?
SELECT (SUM(duration_ms)/1000)/60 AS total_duration
FROM spotifydata;
--164 minutes

--What is the most popular song?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;
--3 songs tied at 95, good 4 u, Bad Habits, and Woman
